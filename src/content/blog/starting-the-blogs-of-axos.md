Blogs ? Why not. Honestly, I never thought about it. But I'm believing that it will be a good way to share some stuff with you, and to keep you updated about what's going on with AxOS. So, let's start this journey together. I hope you will enjoy it.

## Why am i doing that ?

Heh, i see people doing blogs about their projects. I thought that commit messages and releases were enough, but let's be honest, who reads them ? I'm not saying that nobody does, but it's not the best way to share information. 

I'm thinking right now that maybe no one will read these blogs too ðŸ˜… but at least now i have a easier solution. And in these blogs, i can also share stuff that doesn't have a REEEAAAL link with the developement. Cool, huh ? 

## Will i publish often ?

Probably not. I'm not a big fan of writing... But i will try to publish as often as possible. I'm thinking about one blog per month. I hope i will be able to keep this rythm.

The hardest part will be to find ideas to write about. But i'm sure that i will find some.

## Conclusion

I hope you will enjoy these blogs. I will try to make them as interesting as possible. If you have any suggestions, feel free to contact me. I will be happy to hear them. Also, you have the possibility to comment these blogs. I will be happy to read your feedbacks, tips, or anything else. Of course i will answer to you (if it worths it, i will not answer to "Ok" or "Nice blog" ðŸ˜…).
