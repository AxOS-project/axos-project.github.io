A lot of people are saying that i stole [end-4's rice](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland/) to make sleex. 

I would like to be clear about a point: I didn't steal anything. Sleex is **inspired** by end-4's rice. You will now ask me "yeah but the panels are the same and some widgets too", and you will be right. But i wrote them from scratch. I didn't copy/paste his code. By doing this, i would not even know how the code is made, what it does, and how to modify it. The only right thing i could do is to take inspiration from his work. And let's be honest (please don't take it bad end), his rice lacks of features, customization, and is not really user-friendly.

So to be clear, **I wrote everything myself** with his style. This is the exact definition of "inspiration". This way, i know the code and i can modify it as i want. And i can also add features that i want. 

But someday, I will also replace the panels and widgets by my own ones (when I will have an idea of the design i want, i'm not a designer). 

And for the haters, **end-4 gave me his agreement**.

One other point, Sleex is **not a rice**. It's a desktop environment, it's not only a theme. It's like comparing a car to a bike. They are both vehicles, but they are not the same. Take example on Calla. Stella did a rice on awesomewm, but it became so complete that we can now call it a desktop environment.

Okay, so now that this is clarified, I would like to ask your help. I have no other ideas for Sleex. A new style ? New features ? New widgets ? I'm open to any suggestions. Feel free to comment this blog, or to contact me. I will be happy to hear your ideas.
