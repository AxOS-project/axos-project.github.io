Hey AxOS community,

It’s not a secret that passion drives open-source projects. We allocate our time, energy, and creativity into building something meaningful, often alongside our studies, jobs, and personal lives. But what happens when that drive diminishes ? When the thought of diving into a complex codebase feels more like a chore than an exciting challenge?

I dedicated myself to AxOS for almost 5 years now. And recently, I’ve been experiencing a phase where my direct coding output has slowed down significantly. Between university, personal commitments, and preparing for an upcoming internship, I've found myself gravitating towards other activities in my free time. Sometimes it's socialising, other times it's just playing video games (I'm bad at it anyway lol).

And that’s okay.

**It's Not a Bug, It's a Feature (of Being Human)**

The intense focus and energy required for large scale development, especially in a language like Rust that needs precision, can be draining. 

There's a common misconception that "true" developers must be constantly shipping new features and pushing code. But the reality is that our motivation, like any resource, isn't infinite.

Trying to force creativity and complex problem-solving when your mind and body are craving a break often leads to frustration and, paradoxically, less productivity. This isn't about losing passion for development or for AxOS, it's about listening to what your brain needs.

**Different Contributions, Equal Value**

Even if my output of new code has (significantly) slowed down, my commitment to the project hasn't. I will still be active in the "maintenance" side of AxOS. This means I'll still be:
- **Reviewing PRs**: Ensuring the code others write meets our standards.
- **Architectural Oversight**: Making sure the project stays on its intended path.
- **Community Support**: Answering questions and helping where I can.

These "passive" forms of development are just as critical for an open-source project's success as active coding. They keep the project moving even when core members need a break from direct implementation.

**What This Means for AxOS (and You)**

It means we continue to thrive on the collective energy of our community. It highlights the importance of:
- **Distributed Ownership**: When core contributors need to step back, others can step up. And even small contributions help keep the project alive.
- **Diverse Contributions**: Whether you're an expert Rustacean pushing complex features, a new developer fixing a typo, or someone providing crucial feedback, your contribution matters.
- **Empathy and Understanding**: We all face phases of high and low energy. Creating a supportive environment where it’s okay to take a break without guilt is key to sustainable open source.

My love for development and for AxOS is still present. I truly believe this is a phase of recharging and gaining new perspectives. The "itch" to build something new always comes back, often stronger after a period of rest.

If you’re feeling something similar, know that you’re not alone. Take the break you need, engage in different ways, and trust that the passion will return. In the meantime, let’s keep AxOS moving forward, together.

Best,
<br />
