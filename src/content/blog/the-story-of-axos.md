AxOS is starting to be known. A lot of people are using or testing it, but a question is often asked: "Why did you create AxOS ? What is special about it ?". So I will try to answer this question in this blog post.

## Back to the roots

AxOS is a project that I started in 2022. I was looking for a new operating system that combines the best of both worlds: the power and the beauty. Unfortunately, I couldn't find one. So I decided to create my own operating system. I wanted to create an operating system that is fast and beautiful. 

That's how I came up with the idea of AxOS. Then I started learning coding, linux architecture and other stuff like that. I made a lot of mistakes, but I learned a lot too.

The first version of AxOS was a simple script that installed Arch Linux and some packages. It was buggy, I struggled a lot (especially with this damn calamares installer), but I was proud of it. I loved the feeling of creating something and make it evolute. I wanted to share it with the world, so I created a GitHub repository and a website. I started to share my work on social media, but I didn't get a single feedback. Why ? Because I was not known. I was just a random guy on the internet with no marketing skills. But this didn't stop me. I kept working on AxOS, adding new features and fixing bugs. I was learning a lot, and I was having fun. And today, I can say that I am proud of what I have accomplished. AxOS is a beautiful and powerful operating system, even if it is not perfect. I get more feedbacks now, I get more people using it, and I am happy to see that my work is appreciated.

## The goals of AxOS

The main goal of AxOS is to provide a fast and beautiful operating system. That's the main goal, but there is a side goal that came up with time, when I added the Calla desktop environment. 

I want to make a community-driven operating system. I want everyone to be able to contribute to the project, to share their ideas and their work, open pull requests, and to help each other. I want AxOS to be a place where everyone can feel at home, where everyone can share their work and their ideas. And guess what ? This starts to work. I get feedbacks and suggestions, people add features and fix bugs through pull requests, and I even got my first official developer. 

You know, when I see a PR, it has 99% chances to be merged. These simple things make me happy, because it means that people are interested in the project, and that they want to help. 

A 4th desktop environment will be added soon, and I don't even touch it. The dev started it, and this is **his** work, I will not take credit for it. Everyone is free to create their own thing and add it to AxOS. This is what I want. 

## You want to help AxOS ?
